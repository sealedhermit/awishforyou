  "wishText": "In lands afar, where Bottled messages flow,
               Esra, a friend from Turkey, we've come to know.
               With wisdom of a nutritionist, she guides,
               In chats of India and Turkey, our worlds collide.

               Her warmth and kindness, a gentle embrace,
               A year elder, yet her spirit, a youthful grace.
               Through songs exchanged, and photos shared,
               Our bond grows strong, beyond compare.

               On Telegram's shores, our conversations bloom,
               A surprise awaits, in this digital room.
               For Esra, a token of friendship grew,
               A poem to cherish, from me to you.",
